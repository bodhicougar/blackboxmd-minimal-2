**What is a dynamic site?**

Dynamic websites are capable of serving different content to web visitors, even if the web page visitors are requesting the same exact page or viewing the same URL. Most dynamic websites require a database. When visitors request a dynamic web page, code on the web server works to kind of assemble the components of a web page before delivering them to the user. Server side code determines what components or pieces are needed to assemble a complete web page before it is delivered to the user. This can involve a huge variety of variables and logic depending on a websites architecture and purpose.

As an example, web visitors that visit the same URL might see different content in a dynamic site if they are one different devices, different countries, different times of day or even different networks. A web page generated from a dynamic website might have server side code that assembles content from different areas of a database, outside sources, page templates and other elements that are all in different areas of the server. In some dynamic sites, you might even see different elements or contents just by reloading the same web page twice.
