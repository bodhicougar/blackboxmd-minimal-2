### **Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.**

![Jamstack it is!](/images/jamstack-full-logo.svg "The Jamstack")

When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. \
The Jamstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.\
\
Pre-rendered sites can be enhanced with JavaScript and the growing capabilities of browsers and services available via APIs.

# When is your site *not* built with the Jamstack?

Any project that relies on a tight coupling between client and server is not built with the Jamstack. This would include:

> * ### A site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace.
>
>  * ### A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or another backend language.
>
> *  ### A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on the server at runtime.

# Why the Jamstack?

### Better Performance

Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.

### Higher Security

With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.

### Cheaper, Easier Scaling

When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.

### Better Developer Experience

Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.
