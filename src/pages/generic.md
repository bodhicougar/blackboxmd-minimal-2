**Static websites - phase one sites**

Static websites serve the same content to every visitor from a fixed file that is coded in HTML. In the early days of the Internet this is how the first web pages were built. For each individual page of a static website, there is a unique HTML file on a web server with all the content and styles etc, for that complete page. When a website visitor types in a URL or visits a static page on a website, the page that loads will be the exact same for all users.

Static websites typically a more straightforward collection of files (or a collection of files and folders in a directory structure) that are managed by a web master or programmer that is familiar with HTML or some code. When updates need to be made or new pages added, it needs to be done manually by someone who is familiar with code and can code in HTML.

For example, a simple static website with a Home Page and a Contact page will contain two HTML files called something like ‘index.html’ and ‘contact.html’ (for almost all web servers the home page file is named index.html by default). These files would display the same information in a web browser to any user that requests them.

Static websites don’t have a database or require much server side thinking or processing before they deliver or generate a page to the user. They are typically more simple and efficient ways to create and server simple web pages.

As loading speed and security have become more important, static pages have started to re-gain some popularity – particularly with smaller sites that don’t change very often.
